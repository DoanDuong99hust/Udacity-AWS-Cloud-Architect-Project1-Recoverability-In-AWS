1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage 
Amazon RDS automatically switches to a standby replica in another Availability Zone if you have enabled Multi-AZ. The time it takes for the failover to complete depends on the database activity and other conditions at the time the primary DB instance became unavailable. Failover times are typically 60–120 seconds. However, large transactions or a lengthy recovery process can increase failover time

    
2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
        ◦ 00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes) 
        ◦ 00:05 - An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 minutes) 
        ◦ 00:06 - Alert triggers on-all staff (1 minute) 
        ◦ 00:16 - On-call staff may need to get out of bed, get to computer, log in, log onto VPN (10 minutes) 
        ◦ 00:26 - On-call staff starts diagnosing issue (10 minutes) 
        ◦ 00:41 - Root cause is discovered (15 minutes) 
        ◦ 00:46 - Remediation started (5 minutes) :  Promote secondary instance to be the new master and then route the traffic to the new endpoint
        ◦ 00:56 - Remediation completed (10 minutes) 
       Total time: 56 minutes 

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
With the Multi-AZ configuration, we have a synchronous standby copy of the primary database, so there would be no loss of data.  
       
    
4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage 
Since we have a complete read replica in another region, there would be no data loss
